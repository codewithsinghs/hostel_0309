resources/js/router/index.js:

js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import Home from '../components/Home.vue'
import Register from '../components/Register.vue'

const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home },
  { path: '/register', component: Register }
]

export default createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes
})
ðŸš€ 5. Mount Vue App
In resources/js/app.js:

js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import router from './router'
import App from './App.vue'

createApp(App).use(router).mount('#app')
And App.vue:

vue
<template>
  <router-view />
</template>
ðŸ”Œ 6. Preserve Your Styles and Scripts
Since your Blade layout already includes Bootstrap, Swiper, and custom CSS, you donâ€™t need to re-import them in Vue unless you want scoped styling. Vue will render inside the #app div, and your global styles will still apply.

Would you like me to convert one of your actual HTML pages (like the registration page) into a Vue component right now? Just paste it in and Iâ€™ll transform it for you.

can i not use vue without npm
Yes, you can use Vue without NPM, especially if you're aiming for a lightweight setup or want to avoid Node.js entirely. This approach is great for projects that rely on traditional Blade templates and AJAX, like yours.

ðŸ§© How to Use Vue Without NPM in Laravel
âœ… 1. Include Vue via CDN
Just drop this into your Blade layout (app.blade.php) before the closing </body> tag:

html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@3/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script>
This gives you access to Vue 3 in the global scope (Vue.createApp).

ðŸ§± 2. Create a Vue App Inline or in a Separate JS File
You can write Vue directly in your Blade file or link to a separate .js file:

html
<script>
  const { createApp } = Vue;

  createApp({
    data() {
      return {
        message: 'Hello from Vue!'
      }
    }
  }).mount('#vue-app');
</script>
And in your HTML:

html
<div id="vue-app">
  <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
</div>
ðŸ“¦ 3. Use Vue for AJAX and Interactivity
You can still use fetch or axios inside your Vue instance:

js
mounted() {
  fetch('/api/hostel-info')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      this.message = data.description;
    });
